The repo for the course project for Coursera: Getting and Cleaning Data 

Thank you for reviewing my course project!  It is very much appreciated. 

There is only one script in this analysis, so there are no connections to explain.
My run_analysis.R code is thoroughly annotated as to why I did what, and why.
The corresponding code book (CodeBook.md) in this repo explains:
    1. The variables
    2. The data
    3. Transformations and work that I did on the data. 
    
So I am not entirely sure what is intended to go in this ReadMe file....

My script (outside of the setwd() command at the beginning) should be adaptable to wherever someone using
the script has the files stored.  It does expect that the files will remain nested in their test and train 
folders.  

Thanks again, and good luck with your coding!
